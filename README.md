# SMA-Based Space Debris Removal System

## Overview
This project proposes an innovative solution for space debris removal using Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs), a class of smart materials that revert to their original shape when subjected to heat or specific conditions. Led by Dr. Tamesinwer Math from the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Bhagatpur, this system integrates SMA technology with robotic arms, nets, and AI-driven mechanisms to address the growing challenge of orbital debris. The solution aims to enhance efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and ensure adaptability to various debris types in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).

## Problem Statement
Space debris, consisting of defunct satellites, spent rocket stages, and collision fragments, poses significant risks to operational spacecraft. With over 31,000 tracked objects in orbit as of the 2020s (up from ~14,500 in the 2000s), the need for effective Active Debris Removal (ADR) systems is critical to ensure space sustainability and safety.

## Proposed Solution
The project leverages SMA technology, specifically Nickel-Titanium-Niobium (NiTiNb), to develop two primary mechanisms:
1. **SMA-Based Robotic Arm**: Equipped with adaptive grippers and deployable arms for capturing large debris, such as defunct satellites or rocket bodies.
2. **SMA-Based Net**: A thermally activated net that expands to capture small-to-medium debris fragments and contracts to secure them for deorbiting.

### Key Features
- **Material**: NiTiNb SMA (45% Ni, 45% Ti, 10% Nb)
  - High fatigue life (>10,000 actuations)
  - Radiation resistance
  - Transformation temperature: 95°C ± 2°C
  - Operational range: -150°C to +150°C
  - Recovery force: 500-600 MPa
  - Energy efficiency: 60% lower power consumption
- **AI Integration**: Trajectory prediction, collision avoidance, and object detection using hybrid models (LSTM + Kalman Filter + Transformer).
- **Scalability**: Modular design adaptable to debris of varying sizes and shapes.
- **Sustainability**: Reusable modules and energy-efficient operation.

### Advantages Over Existing Technologies
- **Vs. Electrodynamic Tethers**: Faster deorbiting, robust against impacts.
- **Vs. Magnetic/Electrostatic Capture**: Applicable to both metallic and non-metallic debris.
- **Vs. Laser Systems**: Lower power requirements and cost-effective integration.

### Applications
- Capturing large debris (e.g., rocket bodies, spinning satellites).
- Clearing debris clusters in high-risk zones.
- Supporting long-term space missions with reusable systems.

## Technical Details
### SMA Properties
- **High Strength-to-Weight Ratio**: Ideal for lightweight space applications.
- **Durability**: Withstands extreme temperatures, radiation, and micrometeoroid impacts.
- **Thermal Activation**: Utilizes onboard power to trigger shape transformation.

### System Components
1. **Adaptive Grippers**: SMA-powered for precise, flexible capture of irregular debris.
2. **Deployable Structures**: Extendable booms/arms for versatile positioning.
3. **Net Mechanism**: Expands via electricity, contracts to secure debris (analogous to a fishing net).
4. **Sensors**: High-resolution cameras, LiDAR, and multi-spectral imaging for accurate tracking.
5. **Communication**: Robust framework for real-time navigation and coordination.

### Performance Metrics
- **Capture Efficiency**: Up to 80% due to adaptability and energy absorption.
- **Energy Consumption**: Estimated at 120 kJ per operation.
- **Response Time**: 2.85 seconds (industry-leading).

## Scientific Importance
- **Collision Mitigation**: Reduces risks to operational satellites and space assets.
- **Sustainability**: Promotes a debris-free orbital environment.
- **Innovation**: Advances material science and robotics for space applications.

## Global Impact
- Enhances national capabilities in space technology leadership.
- Protects critical orbital pathways for communication, navigation, and research.
- Aligns with international goals for sustainable space exploration.

## Installation and Usage
This is a conceptual project; physical implementation requires:
1. **Hardware**: SMA actuators, robotic arms, net deployment systems, and onboard power sources.
2. **Software**: AI models for trajectory prediction and collision avoidance (e.g., Python with TensorFlow/PyTorch).
3. **Simulation**: Test in a space environment simulator (e.g., STK or custom-built models).

### Prerequisites
- Knowledge of SMA properties and aerospace engineering.
- Access to space-grade materials and testing facilities.
